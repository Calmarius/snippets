# snippets

Small reusable code snippets without dependencies.

## Rules

- All snippets must be self contained and must contain a single algorithm only.
- They are written in C and must be compilable using a freestanding compiler.
- If the algorithm has dependencies (like memory allocation or I/O), these dependencies should be provided as a parameter.
- All algorithms should contain a main function which is used for unit testing using assert statements.
